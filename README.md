# Coursera PROJECT on Getting and Cleaning Data
This repository is created to hosts the R code and other documentation files for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data".

## Overview of the Project

This project aims to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a raw dataset to form a tidy dataset that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository.[Link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
